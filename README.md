# Linkdrop SDK

Linkdrop provides tools to distribute NFTs with links, QR codes or claim codes. The Linkdrop SDK is a Typescript library that can be used to automate creating and managing claim links.   

## Supported networks
Currently, Linkdrop supports the following networks:
- Ethereum Mainnet
- Polygon Mainnet
- Basic Mainnet

Testnets:
- Goerli (Ethereum testnet)
- Mumbai (Polygon testnet)  
- Basic Goerli (Basic testnet)
  
We can add support of any EVM-based chain by request. Please contact us If you need to use Linkdrop on other networks. 

## Getting Started
Create a campaign using Linkdrop Dashboard. When creating a campaign you will need to choose how you want to generate links:
  - Generate claim links via Dashboard interface. 
  - Generate claim links via Linkdrop SDK (see ["Creating claim links"](README.md#creating-claim-links))

## Initializing SDK

First, import SDK into your code:
```ts
import LinkdropBatchSDK from 'linkdrop-batch-sdk'
// or
// const LinkdropBatchSDK = require('linkdrop-batch-sdk').default
```
To use SDK on a tesnet:
```ts
// initializing Linkdrop SDK on a testnet (Goerli or Mumbai)
const apiKey = /* to request an API key, please contact us at hi@linkdrop.io */
const sdk = new LinkdropBatchSDK({ mode: 'testnets', apiKey });
```
To use SDK on a production network (Ethereum Mainnet or Polygon): 
```ts
// initializing Linkdrop SDK on a production network 
const apiKey = /* to request an API key, please contact us at hi@linkdrop.io */
const sdk = new LinkdropBatchSDK({ apiKey });
```

## Claim methods (Can be used on Front-end & Back-end)

The following methods of SDK can be used both in a back-end and a front-end applications, as they don't require providing sensitive campaign keys to invoke them. 

#### Redeeming Link
```ts
const txHash = await sdk.redeem(
  claimCode: string,
  destination: string
)
```
The `redeem` method is used to redeem a claim link, transferring the specified tokens to the recipient address.

Parameters:
1. `claimCode`: The `claimCode` parameter from the claim link URL.
2. `destination`: The recipient address of the tokens.

The redeem method returns tx hash for the claim transaction. 

#### Getting Link Params
To get claim link params via claim code:
```ts
const linkParams = await sdk.getLinkParams(
  claimCode: string
)
```

To get claim link params via link ID:
```ts
const linkParams = await sdk.getLinkParams(
  linkId: string
)
```

**TODO: provide details for linkParams object**

#### Getting Link Status
To retrieve link status and some other info via claim code:
```ts
const	{ 
  status,
  recipient,
  linkId,
  txHash,
  claimedAt,
  createdAtBlock,
} = await sdk.getLinkStatus(
  claimCode: string
)
```
You can also retrieve status by link ID as well:
```ts
const	{ 
  status,
  recipient,
  linkId,
  txHash,
  claimedAt,
  createdAtBlock,
} = await sdk.getLinkStatus(
  linkId: string
)
```

Returns an object with the following properties:
- status: string - The status of the link. Possible values are:
  - `"CREATED"` - The link has been created but has not yet been claimed.
  - `"PENDING"` - The link is waiting for the transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain.
  - `"CLAIMED"` - The link has been successfully claimed.
  - `"FAILED"` - The claim transaction has failed.
  - `"DEACTIVATED"` - The link has been deactivated by the campaign creator.
  - `"EXPIRED"` - The link has expired and can no longer be claimed.
- recipient: string - The Ethereum address to which the tokens have been sent.
- linkId: string - The ID of the link.
- txHash: string - The transaction hash of the claim transaction.
- claimedAt: number - The UNIX timestamp at which the link was claimed.
- createdAtBlock: number - The number of the block in which the link was created.

## Managing Campaigns (FOR BACK-END USE ONLY)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT! Managing campaigns requires secret keys that should never be exposed to public. Use campaign methods on a back-end and never within a front-end app.**

After you have created a campaign using Linkdrop Dashboard, you can use SDK to manage the campaign. 
Using SDK you can: 
- fetch campaign data
- create a new batch of claim links
- add claim links to an existing batch
- fetch created claim links
- activate or deactivate links

#### Getting Campaign
To be able to do all that, first you need to fetch initialize campaign object
```ts
const campaign = await sdk.getCampaign(
  campaignId: string,
  signerKey: string,
  encryptionKey: string
)
```
Get all params from the campaign page on Dashboard:
-  `campaignId`: ID of the campaign that you want to retrieve information about.
-  `signerKey`: private key used to create claim links. **(NEVER EXPOSE SIGNER KEY PUBLICLY)**
-  `encryptionKey`: private key used to encode and decode sensitive data stored on server **(NEVER EXPOSE ENCRYPTION KEY PUBLICLY)**

**⚠️ IMPORTANT! Managing campaigns requires secret keys that should never be exposed to public. Use campaign methods on a back-end and never within a front-end app.**


The returned `campaign` object has campaign data and addtional methods to manage the campaign.   
  
**TODO: provide campaign data details**
```ts
console.log(campaign.data)
```

### Creating claim links
#### Creating new batch 

To create a batch of claim links for the campaign, use the `campaign.createBatch` method
```ts
const batch = await campaign.createBatch(
  [{ 
    id: string,
    amount: string,
    links: string,
    weiAmount?: string // optional parameter, The default value is `0`.
  }],
  // optional parameters
  {
    batchDescription: string,
    shortCodeLength: number,
    shortCodeMixRegister: boolean,
    expirationTime: string
  }
)
```
It takes two parameters:
- `linkData`: This is a required array of objects that contain information about the links to be created. Each object in the array must have the following properties:
  * `id`: token ID for ERC721/ERC1155 campaigns. For ERC20 campaigns, id is not provided.
  * `amount`: amount of tokens per link for ERC20/ERC1155 campaigns. For ERC721 campaigns, amount is not provided.
  * `links`: number of links to create.
  * `weiAmount`: amount of network tokens (ETH/MATIC) to be sent to receiver on claim. Campaign contract should have enough network tokens before claim. Top up the campaign contract in advance manually. The default value is `0`.

- `options`: This is an optional object that can contain the following properties:
  * `batchDescription`: This is an optional string property that specifies the description of the batch. The default value is "Created by SDK".
  * `shortCodeLength`: The length of claimCode. The default value is `12`.
  * `shortCodeMixRegister`: Should the claim code contain uppercase and lowercase symbols. The default value is `true`.
  * `expirationTime`: Timestamp for the link expiration date. The default value is `1900000000000`.

The returned `batch` object contains information related to the specified batch and methods to manage it.  

#### Getting Batches 

To retrieve all batches associated with the campaign, call the `campaign.getBatches` method: 
```ts
const batches = await campaign.getBatches()
```

#### Getting Batch 

To manage a batch, first you need to retrieve it by ID: 
```ts
const batch = await campaign.getBatch(
  batchId: string
) 
```
The returned `batch` object contains information related to the specified batch and methods to manage it.  
**#TODO: provide batch data details**


### Batch methods

#### Adding Links to an existing batch

To add claim links to an existing batch, call the `batch.addLinks` method:
```ts
const links = await batch.addLinks(
  [{ 
    id: string, 
    amount: string, 
    links: string, 
    weiAmount?: string // optional parameter, The default value is `0`.
  }], {
    // optional parameters
    shortCodeLength: number,
    shortCodeMixRegister: boolean,
    expirationTime: string
  }
) 
```

**TODO: link codes?**
It takes two parameters and returns an array of link IDs:
1. `links`: An array of link objects that contain the following properties:
  * `id`: The token ID (required for ERC721/ERC1155 campaigns).
  * `amount`: The amount of tokens per link (required for ERC20/ERC1155 campaigns).
  * `links`: The number of links to be created.
  * `weiAmount`: The amount of native tokens that should be sent to the proxy contract address manually. The default value is `0`.

2. `options`: This is an optional object that can contain the following properties:
  * `shortCodeLength`: The length of claimCode. The default value is `12`.
  * `shortCodeMixRegister`: Should the claim code contain uppercase and lowercase symbols. The default value is `true`.
  * `expirationTime`: Timestamp for the link expiration date. The default value is `1900000000000`.

#### Getting Links
To fetch all links created for that batch, use the `batch.getLinks` method:
```ts
const links = await batch.getLinks()
```

Response data includes claim links in format `https://claim.linkdrop.io/#/...`
If you need links in custom format please provide optional parameter to `getLinks` method
```ts
const links = await batch.getLinks('https://wallet.coinbase.com/claim?tk=code&k=<CODE>&c=<CHAIN_ID>&v=3')
```

As a result you will get claim links with actual claim code (`<CODE>`) and chain id (`<CHAIN_ID>`)



### Deactivating / reactivating links

#### Deactivate Link
To deactivate link:
```ts
const success = await campaign.deactivate(
  claimCode: string
)
```

Parameters:
 - `claimCode`: The `claimCode` parameter from the claim link URL.

#### Reactivate Link
To reactivatate previosly deactivated link:
```ts
const success = await campaign.reactivate(
  claimCode: string
) 
```

Parameters:
1. `claimCode`: The `claimCode` parameter from the claim link URL.
